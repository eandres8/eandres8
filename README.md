### What about me?

In my 7 years of experience as a developer, I have accumulated great knowledge in **Frontend**, **Backend**, **Databases** and **hybrid application development**. I have collaborated in different platforms in sectors such as _Education_, _Fintech_, _Social Security_ among others. I like to read about technology to always have the best tools with which to develop my work every day.

I am currently reinforcing all the knowledge I can get from **Design Patterns and Architecture**. However I want to study topics that I am passionate about such as **computer security** and some **video game development**.
